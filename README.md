Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python.

An introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems using Python 3.5.


## About this course
This course is the first of a two-course sequence:  
1. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python.  
2. Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science.  
Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems.  
Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses.  

The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. 


## What you'll learn
* A Notion of computation  
* The Python programming language  
* Some simple algorithms  
* Testing and debugging  
* An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity  
* Data structures
